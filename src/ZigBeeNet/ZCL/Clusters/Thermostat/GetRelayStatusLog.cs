/**
 * Get Relay Status Log value object class.
 *
 * Cluster: Thermostat. Command is sentTO the server.
 * This command is a specific command used for the Thermostat cluster.
 *
 * The Get Relay Status Log command is used to query the thermostat internal relay status log. This command has no payload. * <br> * The log storing order is First in First Out (FIFO) when the log is generated and stored into the Queue. * <br> * The first record in the log (i.e., the oldest) one, is the first to be replaced when there is a new record and there is * no more space in the log. Thus, the newest record will overwrite the oldest one if there is no space left. * <br> * The log storing order is Last In First Out (LIFO) when the log is being retrieved from the Queue by a client device. * Once the "Get Relay Status Log Response" frame is sent by the Server, the "Unread Entries" attribute * SHOULD be decremented to indicate the number of unread records that remain in the queue. * <br> * If the "Unread Entries"attribute reaches zero and the Client sends a new "Get Relay Status Log Request", the Server * MAY send one of the following items as a response: * <br> * i) resend the last Get Relay Status Log Response * or * ii) generate new log record at the time of request and send Get Relay Status Log Response with the new data *
 * Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
